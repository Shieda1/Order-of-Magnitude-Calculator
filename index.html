    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the order of magnitude<br> 
    What is the order of magnitude?<br>
    The order of magnitude is an approximation of the logarithm of a value relative to some contextually understood reference value, usually 10, interpreted as the base of the logarithm and the representative of values of magnitude one.
    How to calculate order of magnitude?<br>
    To calculate order of magnitude you should use the following formula:<br>
    N = a * 10^b<br>
    where:<br>
    N	=	order of magnitude of a number<br>
    a	=	integer a<br>
    b	=	order of magnitude of the number<br>
    Why use order of magnitude?<br>
    The order of magnitude is used in order to make approximate comparisons. If numbers differ by one order of magnitude then x is about ten times different in quantity than y. If values differ by two orders of magnitude then they differ by a factor of about 100.<br>
